# InterviewTask_Tree_Operations
Task was to recreate binary tree structure...

![tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29871604/76974481-8ee66800-6931-11ea-815d-9e58628b4f02.jpg)

...and provide functions for:
* sum of values in all nodes in subtree;
* median value from tree;
* average value from tree.

I achive that by writing some recursion functions along with tests in Junit5.
